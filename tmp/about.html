        >An acknowledged leader in defining architectural excellence, in mass
        communications, and in creating organizations with integrity.</em
    >
</p>
<p>
    Robert A. Ivy, FAIA, has served as an accomplished leader in two of the most
    influential positions in architecture, each for over a decade—as Chief
    Executive Officer of the American Institute of Architects and as
    Editor-in-Chief of Architectural Record, one of the most-widely known
    professional publications in the world. In both roles, he tackled the
    critical issues of our time and left the organizations remarkably changed
    for the better and poised for a new generation of growth.
</p>
<p>
    As CEO of the AIA, Robert helped grow the association to record membership,
    at its high point reaching more than 95,000 members, all during difficult
    periods in American life, including the pandemic, racial reckoning, and the
    politics that divide the nation. The intentional curation of a talented,
    high performing team of senior leaders and staff enabled that tremendous
    success, together with emphasis on critical issues--climate action and
    equity, diversity, and inclusion.
</p>
<p>
    Among his chief accomplishments is repositioning the association for the
    21st century, an ongoing effort that has resulted in a bolder, assertive
    AIA. Through this transformation, he championed an extensive professional
    public outreach program, strengthened AIA’s advocacy presence, refocused the
    organization on its core values and revived its vital research and
    educational agenda. He also spearheaded additional change, including
    transforming AIA’s governance, launching a new foundation focused on
    minority scholarships, making AIA a ”digital first’ organization, and
    expanding its profitable lines of business.
</p>
<p>
    He has served as a frequent keynote speaker, panelist, moderator, and media
    spokesperson for events coast to coast and around the world, from the White
    House and the Monterey Design Conference to gatherings in Europe and Asia.
    He has been interviewed by the Atlantic, the Wall Street Journal, Fortune,
    Bloomberg News, the San Francisco Chronicle, and many others.
</p>
<p>
    Prior to joining the AIA in 2011, Ivy served as longtime Editor-in-Chief of
    McGraw-Hill’s <em>Architectural Record</em>, a venerable New York-based
    publication. With his guidance, Record became the most widely disseminated
    architectural journal worldwide, a leader in addressing the critical
    questions of the time. <strong><em>Record</em></strong
    >’s staff was nearby when planes hit the twin towers in 2001, an event that
    provoked a leadership role for the publication as it helped guide the city
    and the nation toward a new design for Ground Zero. Likewise, the
    publication was active early in the aftermath of Hurricane Camille,
    establishing an early partnership with Tulane University.
</p>
<p>
    The publication developed editorial policies that drove significant
    discussion on technology, practice, and sustainability, as well as
    community-based design.
</p>
<p>
    As Vice-President and Editorial Director for McGraw-Hill’s design and
    construction division, Ivy oversaw numerous print and web properties in the
    design and construction portfolio and sat on the senior leadership of the
    construction group, which included Dodge Database.
</p>
<p>
    During his tenure, Ivy and <em>Architectural Record</em> garnered numerous
    awards, including the National Magazine Award for General Excellence, an
    unusual accomplishment for a professional publication, and more than 30
    Jesse Neal awards for business journalism.
</p>
<p>
    In 2009, Ivy received the G.D. Crain award for his lifetime contributions to
    business media. The following year, he joined I.M. Pei, FAIA, as one of two
    living recipients of the title “Master Architect” by Alpha Rho Chi, a
    professional educational fraternity founded in 1914. He is the only
    architect thus honored in the 21<sup>st</sup> century.
</p>
<p>
    His book, <em>Fay Jones: Architect</em>, was cited with the George
    Wittenborn Award for the “highest standards of scholarship, design, and
    production.” It will be reissued in its third printing by the University of
    Arkansas press in 2022.
</p>
<p>
    He served three times as the U.S. Commissioner at the Venice Architectural
    Biennale, and he is a member of CICA, the International Circle of
    Architecture Critics. Since 2018, he has been awarded two lifetime
    achievement awards: the Noel Polk Lifetime Achievement Award from the
    Mississippi Institute of Arts and Letters (2020), the organization’s first
    architect recipient, joining a small group of distinguished Mississippians
    including Eudora Welty and Leontyne Price; and another from the National
    Institute of Building Science for advancing architecture and the building
    sciences.
</p>
<p>
    Ivy earned an M. Arch. Degree from Tulane University, and a BA (cum laude)
    in English from Sewanee: The University of the South (TN).
</p>
<p>
    Prior to his career in New York and Washington, Ivy practiced architecture
    in Columbus, MS, his hometown, where he lived with his wife and their three
    children. A dedicated preservationist, he still maintains an historic home
    there called Lehmquen (1837). Both he and his wife Holly have been cited by
    the Mississippi Department of Archives and History for their contributions
    to historic preservation in Mississippi.

    Throughout his career in Mississippi, Ivy maintained a dual career, as an
    architect and as a writer. Ivy’s writing experience centered on the work of
    contemporary architects in the American South, a subject he pioneered and
    mastered. Beginning in 1977, he wrote regularly for a list of publications,
    including <strong>Architecture South</strong>, a 10,000-circulation
    publication he co-founded and disseminated in 5 states for the Gulf States
    region of the AIA. Among other roles, he guest edited an issue of a Japanese
    journal, <strong>A+U</strong>, and wrote as a contributing editor regularly
    for <strong>The AIA Journal</strong> and
    <strong>Architecture </strong>magazine, all before becoming editor in chief
    of <strong>Architectural Record in 1996</strong>.
