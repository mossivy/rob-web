                     Ivy has been a prolific writer and contributor to
                     publications. In addition to monthly editorials and
                     articles throughout his long tenure at Architectural
                     Record, he has contributed introductions, prefaces,
                     forewords, essays, and articles to books about the built
                     environment. His written work on the architect, E. Fay
                     Jones, FAIA, is the standard today, and he continues to
                     write about Jones and his contributions to contemporary

                     Throughout his career in Mississippi, Ivy maintained a dual
                     career, as an architect and as a writer. Ivy’s writing
                     experience centered on the work of contemporary architects
                     in the American South, a subject he pioneered and mastered.
                     Beginning in 1977, he wrote regularly for a list of
                     publications, including
                     <strong>Architecture South</strong>, a 10,000-circulation
