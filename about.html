                  <p>
                     Robert A. Ivy, FAIA, has served as an accomplished leader
                     in two of the most influential positions in architecture,
                     each for over a decade—as Chief Executive Officer of the
                     American Institute of Architects and as Editor-in-Chief of
                     Architectural Record, one of the most-widely known
                     professional publications in the world. In both roles, he
                     tackled the critical issues of our time and left the
                     organizations remarkably changed for the better and poised
                     for a new generation of growth.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     As CEO of the AIA, Robert helped grow the association to
                     record membership, at its high point reaching more than
                     95,000 members, all during difficult periods in American
                     life, including the pandemic, racial reckoning, and the
                     politics that divide the nation. The intentional curation
                     of a talented, high performing team of senior leaders and
                     staff enabled that tremendous success, together with
                     emphasis on critical issues--climate action and equity,
                     diversity, and inclusion.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     Among his chief accomplishments is repositioning the
                     association for the 21st century, an ongoing effort that
                     has resulted in a bolder, assertive AIA. Through this
                     transformation, he championed an extensive professional
                     public outreach program, strengthened AIA’s advocacy
                     presence, refocused the organization on its core values and
                     revived its vital research and educational agenda. He also
                     spearheaded additional change, including transforming AIA’s
                     governance, launching a new foundation focused on minority
                     scholarships, making AIA a ”digital first’ organization,
                     and expanding its profitable lines of business.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     He has served as a frequent keynote speaker, panelist,
                     moderator, and media spokesperson for events coast to coast
                     and around the world, from the White House and the Monterey
                     Design Conference to gatherings in Europe and Asia. He has
                     been interviewed by the Atlantic, the Wall Street Journal,
                     Fortune, Bloomberg News, the San Francisco Chronicle, and
                     many others.

                  <p>
                     Prior to joining the AIA in 2011, Ivy served as longtime
                     Editor-in-Chief of McGraw-Hill’s
                     <em>Architectural Record</em>, a venerable New York-based
                     publication. With his guidance, Record became the most
                     widely disseminated architectural journal worldwide, a
                     leader in addressing the critical questions of the time.
                     <strong><em>Record</em></strong
                     >’s staff was nearby when planes hit the twin towers in
                     2001, an event that provoked a leadership role for the
                     publication as it helped guide the city and the nation
                     toward a new design for Ground Zero. Likewise, the
                     publication was active early in the aftermath of Hurricane
                     Camille, establishing an early partnership with Tulane
                     University.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     The publication developed editorial policies that drove
                     significant discussion on technology, practice, and
                     sustainability, as well as community-based design.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     As Vice-President and Editorial Director for McGraw-Hill’s
                     design and construction division, Ivy oversaw numerous
                     print and web properties in the design and construction
                     portfolio and sat on the senior leadership of the
                     construction group, which included Dodge Database.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     During his tenure, Ivy and
                     <em>Architectural Record</em> garnered numerous awards,
                     including the National Magazine Award for General
                     Excellence, an unusual accomplishment for a professional
                     publication, and more than 30 Jesse Neal awards for
                     business journalism.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     In 2009, Ivy received the G.D. Crain award for his lifetime
                     contributions to business media. The following year, he
                     joined I.M. Pei, FAIA, as one of two living recipients of
                     the title “Master Architect” by Alpha Rho Chi, a
                     professional educational fraternity founded in 1914. He is
                     the only architect thus honored in the 21<sup>st</sup>
                     century.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     His book, <em>Fay Jones: Architect</em>, was cited with the
                     George Wittenborn Award for the “highest standards of
                     scholarship, design, and production.” It will be reissued
                     in its third printing by the University of Arkansas press
                     in 2022.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     He served three times as the U.S. Commissioner at the
                     Venice Architectural Biennale, and he is a member of CICA,
                     the International Circle of Architecture Critics. Since
                     2018, he has been awarded two lifetime achievement awards:
                     the Noel Polk Lifetime Achievement Award from the
                     Mississippi Institute of Arts and Letters (2020), the
                     organization’s first architect recipient, joining a small
                     group of distinguished Mississippians including Eudora
                     Welty and Leontyne Price; and another from the National
                     Institute of Building Science for advancing architecture
                     and the building sciences.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     Ivy earned an M. Arch. Degree from Tulane University, and a
                     BA (cum laude) in English from Sewanee: The University of
                     the South (TN).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     Prior to his career in New York and Washington, Ivy
                     practiced architecture in Columbus, MS, his hometown, where
                     he lived with his wife and their three children. A
                     dedicated preservationist, he still maintains an historic
                     home there called Lehmquen (1837). Both he and his wife
                     Holly have been cited by the Mississippi Department of
                     Archives and History for their contributions to historic
                     preservation in Mississippi.

                     His role as lecturer, panelist, and moderator continues to
                     this day. In 2024, he addressed the Design Committee of the
                     Texas Society of Architects on contemporary French
                     architecture at Chateau LaCoste, near Aix-en-Provence, and
                     the following month he spoke to the national committee on
                     design in Thorncrown Chapel designed by Fay Jones, FAIA.
                     Ivy has regularly addressed university audiences including,
                     recently, the University of Arkansas and the Recognition
                     Day lecture at the Mississippi State University Department

                     Ivy has been a prolific writer and contributor to
                     publications. He has contributed introductions, prefaces,
                     forewords, essays, and articles to books about the built
                     environment. His written work on the architect, E. Fay
                     Jones, FAIA, is the standard today, and he continues to
                     write about Jones and his contributions to contemporary
                     architecture. A representative sampling of Ivy’s work is

                     Throughout his career in Mississippi, Ivy maintained a dual
                     career, as an architect and as a writer. Ivy’s writing
                     experience centered on the work of contemporary architects
                     in the American South, a subject he pioneered and mastered.
                     Beginning in 1977, he wrote regularly for a list of
                     publications, including
                     <strong>Architecture South</strong>, a 10,000-circulation
                     publication he co-founded and disseminated in 5 states for
                     the Gulf States region of the AIA. Among other roles, he
                     guest edited an issue of a Japanese journal,
                     <strong>A+U</strong>, and wrote as a contributing editor
                     regularly for <strong>The AIA Journal</strong> and
                     <strong>Architecture </strong>magazine, all before becoming
                     editor in chief of
                     <strong>Architectural Record in 1996</strong>.
